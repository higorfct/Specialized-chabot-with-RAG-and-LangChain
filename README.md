# 🧠 Fintech Customer Support RAG Agent  

## 📘 Overview  
This project implements a **Large Language Model (LLM)** chatbot using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture, developed in the simulated context of a **fintech company**.  
The agent is designed to **automate part of customer support**, providing accurate and contextualized answers about financial products, onboarding, security, and compliance.  

By combining **natural language generation** with **information retrieval** from a reference document (`fintech_manual.pdf`), the system delivers consistent and policy-aligned responses.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Demonstrate the application of **RAG pipelines** in financial contexts.  
- Reduce the average response time in support interactions.  
- Increase **response consistency and quality** across customer inquiries.  
- Serve as a prototype for future integration into real support environments.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **LangChain** – orchestration and context retrieval pipeline  
- **OpenAI GPT Models** – natural language generation  
- **FAISS** – vector indexing and semantic search  
- **PyPDFLoader** – extraction and processing of the reference document

## 💡 Technical and Business Impact  

### 📊 Business Impact  
- **Operational efficiency:** acts as a first-line assistant, handling repetitive queries and freeing human agents for complex cases.  
- **Cost reduction:** decreases the time and resources spent on low-value interactions.  
- **Consistent communication:** ensures alignment with financial compliance and internal policies.  
- **Enhanced customer experience:** faster, contextual, and human-like responses.  

### 🧩 Technical Impact  
- Modular and scalable architecture, easily extendable to new documents and domains.  
- Strong foundation for integration with internal systems and APIs.  
- Potential for continuous improvement through feedback and model evaluation.

## 🚀 Next Steps  
- Add a web interface using **Streamlit** or **Gradio**.  
- Enable dynamic upload of multiple documents and financial domains (credit, investment, insurance).  
- Implement **source citation** in responses.  
- Evaluate performance metrics such as latency and contextual accuracy.

## 🔒 Security Note  
Never expose API keys directly in the code.  
Use environment variables (`.env`) or secret management services such as:  
- AWS Secrets Manager  
- GCP Secret Manager  
- Azure Key Vault
